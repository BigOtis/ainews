Baker is the director of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Dr. Baker chaired the National Research Council’s 2013-2022 Decadal Survey in Solar and Space Physics.\n\n\n\nRobotic space programs have been one of the greatest achievements of the United States. These programs have been the source of unparalleled success, technical achievement, and leadership for over 65 years. This is why scientific spacecraft programs are too important to our nation’s welfare and our leadership in the world to ever shortchange or undervalue them through poor policy decisions.\n\n\n\nThe first objective in the Space Act of 1958 — and still the first objective to this day — is “The expansion of human knowledge of phenomena in the atmosphere and space.” Due to the power and importance of this objective, our home planet Earth, every major body from our Sun through Mercury all the way out to Pluto, and the universe far beyond have been explored and continue to be explored.\n\n\n\nThis amazing record of robotic mission success and compelling accomplishment deserves unstinting support from our government and the taxpaying public. And, indeed, over the past several years the science portion of NASA, the Science Mission Directorate, has received strong budgetary support. Unfortunately, in the most recent President’s Budget Request (PBR) for Fiscal Year 2024, there was highly disappointing news. While NASA as a whole received a relatively healthy proposed budget increase for FY24, the science part of NASA was slated to have some effective budget decreases. Specific disciplines like Astrophysics would receive only a 3% increase, and Heliophysics is proposed to have decreased funding compared with the 2023 enacted budget. Such a level of science funding would obviously not keep up with the present inflation rate and risks pitting human exploration against science where, through Artemis, such a partnership is not only wanted but required. Per both Administrator Bill Nelson and Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy, science is a key motivation for the Artemis program and is built into all aspects of that program. Unfortunately, to many scientists, these statements by administrators ring hollow based on the 2024 proposed budget.\n\n\n\n\nThe NASA science program has had great challenges in recent times. The COVID pandemic, affecting many elements of society, made it exceedingly difficult to permit science and engineering teams to work on flight missions in the ways originally planned. This has caused unavoidable complications for solar, Earth, planetary, and astrophysical program developments. Yet, in contrast to many other federal science agencies, effectively no funding was appropriated to NASA to offset such impacts. Moreover, supply chain issues for the material and sophisticated hardware of space systems have delayed mission development by weeks, months, and in some cases, years. NASA’s Science leadership has done a laudable job during these times, racking up success after success. Nevertheless, this recent turmoil has caused NASA missions to cost more than had been budgeted in the pre-COVID planning stages and has added stress for the vital U.S.-wide research community that relies on these programs.\n\n\n\nOne of the most concerning messages contained in the FY24 PBR was that the Administration would propose to place missions of greatest national necessity by NASA’s own admission — studying our near-Earth space environment — in a “pause” mode. If this PBR plan were to be adopted, a highest priority flight mission called the Geospace Dynamics Constellation (GDC) would be forced to slow to a snail’s pace. This six-satellite space program was a top priority in the last Solar and Space Physics (Heliophysics) decadal survey issued by the U.S. National Academies in 2013.  GDC was re-endorsed by the Academies’ mid-term review released in February 2020. I chaired the 2013 Decadal advisory report for the Academies, and I can say without equivocation that we as a nation (and as a spacefaring world) need GDC desperately, even more so today than when it was initially proposed. We must understand the interaction of our Sun with Earth’s upper atmosphere and ionosphere.\n\n\n\nThere presently are hundreds of spacecraft operating in low-Earth orbit (LEO). Soon there will be thousands of such spacecraft that are helping provide our world with high-speed global communication, precise position and navigation guidance, weather and climate preparedness, and countless other crucial societal benefits. Furthermore, the upper atmosphere is also a key loss region for orbital debris which constitutes one of the main threats to humanity’s ability to utilize low-Earth orbit and for which remarkably little is known. All these benefits are at risk — especially with the powerful increase in solar activity as Solar Cycle 25 peaks — without the better scientific understanding of the Sun-Earth connection that only GDC can and will provide.\n\n\n\nI call upon the Biden administration to reconsider promptly and thoughtfully these ill-advised budget actions proposed in their FY24 PBR. I would urge that the Administration recognize fully the kind of stresses that science and technology programs have endured because of COVID, and remedy their impact as they have done for other agencies. The budgets for all science disciplines should be boosted appropriately to allow programs to be carried out successfully and in a timely and cost-effective way. Certainly, our nation and its agencies should not choose this time of great observational need to place the space program on a starvation diet. I also call upon Congress to help remedy these debilitating deficiencies of the PBR and ensure that key programs such as GDC are carried out on time and without fail. \n\n\n\n“Leadership is fragile”, said famed NASA flight director Gene Kranz. This is especially the case as the U.S. enters into a new competition with other nation-states. We must protect and project leadership especially in the very area on which all of NASA is built: “the expansion of human knowledge of phenomena in the atmosphere and space.” This is an activity worthy of the support of a nation that is more inspired, more protected, and more powerful as a result of these programs.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel N.

The spacecraft, launched in 2006, flew by Pluto in 2015 and the Kuiper Belt object Arrokoth in early 2019, and will continue to traverse the Kuiper Belt through 2028.\n\n\n\nThe project team had proposed a multidisciplinary science mission for New Horizons, conducing a mix of astrophysics, heliophysics and planetary science research. The focus is “only things that can be done by dint of being at that great distance or in the Kuiper Belt,” said Alan Stern, principal investigator for New Horizons, at a meeting of the Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) here May 3.\n\n\n\nNASA, as part of the planetary science senior review that considered proposals from New Horizons and other spacecraft seeking extended missions, only approved funding for two years, rather than three as requested. The agency elected to fund New Horizons through fiscal year 2024 as part of the planetary science division, then have the mission compete in a separate senior review for the heliophysics division for fiscal year 2025 and beyond.\n\n\n\n\nThe agency’s rationale was that the planetary science that New Horizons could do was less compelling than astrophysics and heliophysics. The senior review gave the overall proposal a score of “excellent/very good”, the second-highest possible score, but the planetary portion was rated “very good/good”, two levels lower.\n\n\n\n“The proposed Kuiper belt object (KBO) studies are unlikely to dramatically improve the state of knowledge,” the senior review report stated. New Horizons would be able to observe several KBOs at a distance, and at viewing angles not possible from the Earth, but the report concluded that those observations would not be competitive with ground-based observations.\n\n\n\n“We think that this is shortsighted,” Stern said. “It was the only mission ever sent and the only mission planned to study the Kuiper Belt, and we’re still there.”\n\n\n\nHe said that while the mission was invited to submit a proposal to the heliophysics senior review, it has decided not to do so. His concern was that New Horizons would become an “infrastructure” mission for heliophysics without a dedicated science team but instead teams that run the spacecraft’s instruments. “I dub them ‘zombie’ teams.”\n\n\n\n“Writing a proposal to walk the plank, if you will, writing a proposal for the entire science team to be disbanded, did not look like something that we wanted to do,” Stern said. “We were afraid that the proposal would be accepted.”\n\n\n\nThat puts the future of New Horizons after fiscal year 2024 in limbo. “We are in a quandary. I don’t know what we’re going to do about it,” said Curt Niebur, lead scientist for flight programs in NASA’s planetary science division, at the OPAG meeting. NASA had hoped the mission would accept the senior review outcome. “That path is broken.”\n\n\n\n\nHe acknowledges, though, there had been a “miscommunication” on NASA’s part about the ability of New Horizons to do planetary science, particularly if scientists find a Kuiper Belt object in range of the spacecraft for a close flyby. “Should a KBO be found, yes, let’s talk about it. Let’s see if it’s reachable,” he said. “Let’s continue the search and we’ll take that up at the time that we find it.”\n\n\n\nHowever, another KBO flyby appears unlikely. “It’s a needle-in-a-haystack problem. We’re looking,” he said, efforts that have included upgrading an instrument on the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii to better look for targets. “The odds are against us.”\n\n\n\nThat search, he argued, would become impossible if NASA’s plans for New Horizon go forward. “I doubt we’ll get any telescope time in 2024 because the planetary portion of the mission is ending,” he said, as observatories decide to allocate telescope time to others.\n\n\n\nIn March, NASA issued a request for information for a potential “New Horizons Interstellar Mission” that would continue the mission after fiscal year 2024. It sought ideas for heliophysics and other science the mission could do in 2025 through 2027 “to gauge the level of interest of the wider science community in pursuing the next phase of science leadership for the mission” and the costs to do so.\n\n\n\nThe document stated that “mission operations would be terminated at the end of the second extended mission” at the end of fiscal year 2024, but both Niebur and Stern emphasized at the OPAG meeting that there are no plans by NASA to turn off the spacecraft.\n\n\n\n“The senior review did not suggest that the mission be truncated,” Niebur said. “NASA is not suggesting we turn off New Horizons.”\n\n\n\n“NASA is not planning to turn the spacecraft off, simply to terminate the planetary mission and to dismiss the planetary team,” Stern said.\n\n\n\nWhile NASA’s planetary programs have struggled with cost issues, from potential increasing costs for Mars Sample Return to the delay in the Psyche launch that has pushed back the VERITAS Venus mission by three years, New Horizons takes up a minute part of the overall planetary budget. NASA requested $9.7 million for the mission in its fiscal year 2024 budget proposal, less than 0.3% of the overall planetary science budget of $3.38 billion.\n\n\n\n“We need to finish the Kuiper Belt,” Stern said, “We finally got a spacecraft here. We’re going to leave the Kuiper Belt in a few years. Why so impatient over pennies out of the planetary budget?”\n\n\n\nSome at the OPAG meeting suggested that a solution would require some improved cooperation among NASA’s science divisions, including perhaps a more equitable sharing of mission costs. “Meritorious science can be achieved in heliophysics, astrophysics and planetary science but science optimization will require creative problem solving and cross-divisional leadership,” the senior review report stated.\n\n\n\n“The longer you explore space, the more cross-divisional it becomes,” said Pontus Brandt of the Applied Physics Lab, who joined the New Horizons science team last year to support heliophysics studies. “Nature doesn’t really care about divisions and we need to figure out how to support that.”\n\n\t"},{"title":"Dragonfly mission studying effects of potential budget cut","link":"https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9kcmFnb25mbHktbWlzc2lvbi1zdHVkeWluZy1lZmZlY3RzLW9mLXBvdGVudGlhbC1idWRnZXQtY3V0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen","image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Wph3AO9XEjXsC779CrWf91lVU-Th9qD_K3mYBNFtekscZ69r3PEwBEQcGCbI4fJOywtyF5CKw1xce3mAdzyTBrDdgS4wvgVEC5p5YBPFTiIdUIid3Z-oiJwFOlu0HJw1KryTw0K0w4LFKLTIiHU2DGJEq448B_uXOsZ4zUs=s0-w100-h100-rw-dcFXWO6i0G","source":false,"datetime":"2023-05-06T19:42:50.000Z","time":"18 hours ago","related":[],"text":"\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nLAUREL, Md. — A proposed cut of nearly 20% in the budget for NASA’s Dragonfly mission to Saturn’s moon Titan in 2024 could force changes to the mission or its schedule, a top project official said May 3.\n\n\n\nNASA’s fiscal year 2024 budget proposal requested $327.7 million for Dragonfly, a rotorcraft that would land on Titan and then fly through the moon’s dense atmosphere, going to various locations to study the building blocks of life. Dragonfly is scheduled for launch in 2027, landing on Titan in 2034.\n\n\n\nThe budget proposal reflects an 18.1% reduction from the $400.1 million Dragonfly received in fiscal year 2023. NASA’s budget document says only the agency “updated the budget profile to reflect updated estimates for a launch readiness date of June 2027.”\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a meeting of the Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) here May 3, Zibi Turtle, principal investigator for Dragonfly at the Applied Physics Lab, said the fiscal year 2024 proposal affects plans for the mission. “The NASA budget request for FY24 would fund Dragonfly at a level that is below what we estimate is necessary over our profile,” she said.\n\n\n\n\nShe did not specify how much of a difference there is between the request and the mission’s profile, but said the project is looking at options on how to address that shortfall. “We are still in that process of evaluating cost and schedule options moving forward.”\n\n\n\nDragonfly completed its preliminary design review in early March, which Turtle said went well. The mission is preparing for a confirmation review, where NASA will set a formal cost estimate and launch date for the project, in the early fall, and she noted that evaluation of cost and schedule options would be part of planning for the confirmation review.\n\n\n\nThe proposed cut has gotten the attention of members of Congress. In back-to-back hearings in April, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.) asked NASA Administrator Bill Nelson about the proposed cut. The Applied Physics Lab, which is leading Dragonfly, is based in Maryland.\n\n\n\n“Everything I know from the experts is that it doesn’t compute. You can’t cut by 20% and still remain on target,” Van Hollen said in a Senate appropriations hearing April 18.\n\n\n\nNelson said in both hearings that the cut would not delay Dragonfly’s 2027 launch. “We are still planning on launching Dragonfly in ’27. That has not changed,” Nelson told Ruppersberger at a House appropriations hearing April 19. “Right now, there is not any plan for a cut in fiscal year ’24.”\n\n\n\nEarlier at the OPAG meeting, other NASA officials attempted to explain the reduced funding for the mission as part of the variability of the overall appropriations process. “It’s kind of a moving target,” said Henry Throop, a program scientist in NASA’s planetary science division, May 2. “This is enough for continued development of the mission.”\n\n\n\n\n“The budget process doesn’t provide certainty,” said Curt Niebur, lead scientist for flight programs in NASA’s planetary science division, but he emphasized that NASA supported the mission.\n\n\n\n“Dragonfly has had a rough road programmatically,” he said, a reference to issues such as a one-year delay in the launch NASA announced in 2020 to cover costs outside the mission itself, such as the effect of the pandemic on other planetary missions. “There’s a commitment to traveling that rough road at all levels, from the project on up.”\n\n\n\nDealing with operations costs\n\n\n\nThe pandemic has been one key factor in rising costs of planetary missions in general. Another, Niebur said at the OPAG meeting May 2, was growing costs of operating missions once they are launched.\n\n\n\nHe said that planetary missions are overrunning their estimated costs for operations, known as Phase E in NASA programmatic parlance, by an average of 52% over their original proposals. “We have a big Phase E problem.”\n\n\n\nMissions have argued that they can’t provide updated estimates for operations costs until a review called Key Decision Point E, within a few months of launch. He suggested that puts NASA in a bind, since by that time the spacecraft is completed and ready for launch. “What do you think the chances are that we say no to that, when we’re two months from launch?” he said. “That is devastating our ability to plan ahead.”\n\n\n\nThe problems with increased operations costs across the board, Niebur said. “Every planetary mission has a Phase E upper,” or increase, he said. NASA’s Science Mission Directorate is starting study to look at cost growth in operations of planetary and other missions.\n\n\n\nHe placed much of the blame for the operations cost increases on those proposing missions, for failing to look at performance of earlier missions as well as rejecting proposals to place a cap on Phase E costs on future missions. “We seem unable, unwilling, reluctant to look back at past performance and use that to guide our missions for the future,” he said. “That ends now.”\n\n\t"},{"title":"DoD spending on commercial space services negligible, despite ...","link":"https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9kb2Qtc3BlbmRpbmctb24tY29tbWVyY2lhbC1zcGFjZS1zZXJ2aWNlcy1uZWdsaWdpYmxlLWRlc3BpdGUtZ3Jvd2luZy1zcGFjZS1mb3JjZS1idWRnZXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen","image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/erIgObt1i_V-8mKgDKSwFR7K6YfcWp_6XL2d-UM5h7pdf6qx4IoWp9sU8koHCF8SoQ39X6bgH0Je5N-agO21YIhblpcByqNoKyf0Jctlew9L9cUK5iy4njIsm7tsrOj1FWSsVsI8QIaKngwIdkhP2xIgSRmWMoQjH7jferjePw1QBlQ=s0-w100-h100-rw-dcAWCatrDogUwC","source":false,"datetime":"2023-05-05T13:36:04.000Z","time":"2 days ago","related":[],"text":"\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWASHINGTON — Pentagon officials have called attention to DoD’s need to access commercial space industry services. However, very little of the Space Force’s budget is being allocated to these types of services, a space industry and budget analyst said May 2.\n\n\n\nCommercial space services — enabled by increasingly capable small satellites and cheaper access to orbit — include imagery, space surveillance, weather data, broadband communications and others that could be procured as an alternative to traditional acquisitions. \n\n\n\nWhat the Space Force budget shows is that, other than satellite communications, very few technologies today are bought as services, analyst Mike Tierney, head of legislative affairs at the National Security Space Association, said at a briefing on Capitol Hill.\n\n\n\nThe Pentagon’s funding proposal for fiscal year 2024 seeks $30 billion for the U.S. Space Force, which DoD called its largest ever space budget. \n\n\n\n\nMost of that funding is for the development and procurement of next-generation satellite constellations and other systems that the government owns and operates. Tierney said it’s difficult to quantify spending on commercial space services because there is no separate funding line for that. He estimates it is only a small fraction of overall spending. \n\n\n\n“It’s a fair question, and definitely a question I get a lot,” said Tierney.\n\n\n\n“I’m always looking inside of these buckets for commercial activity that meets the expectations of what the industry thinks a commercial capability is,” he said. “But we’re talking about really a fraction of the totality of that $30 billion.”\n\n\n\nTierney said there is a mismatch between the industry’s expectations of DoD as a customer of commercial space services and the actual dollars that are being spent on these emerging technologies.  \n\n\n\n“There remains a disconnect between what industry wants and believes the department should be doing relative to commercial space investments,” Tierney said. “And I think there will continue to be that friction between what the industry wants and what the government is willing to let go.”\n\n\n\nTierney said one of the government’s reservations about commercial systems is network security. “Every time you bring up commercial services in these conversations, that is often a concern,” he added. \n\n\n\n\nThe use of commercial services will likely grow over time,“but there’s still a way to go from what I think the industry is looking for.”\n\n\n\nSpace Force office to buy commercial services\n\n\n\nA military official from the U.S. Space Systems Command meets with private sector executives at the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs. Credit: Space Systems Command \n\n\n\nThe Space Systems Command based in Los Angeles last year stood up a Commercial Services Office — recently rebranded as the Commercial Space Office — in the Washington D.C. area. \n\n\n\nThe office, run by Col. Richard Kniseley, materiel leader at Space Systems Command, was created to figure out what services could be bought from the private sector to supplement or replace government-owned systems.\n\n\n\nBut making that transition could take years until procurement cycles and DoD’s budget process catch up with users’ demands, said the acting deputy director of the Commercial Space Force Jeremy Leader.\n\n\n\nSpeaking last month at an AFCEA Los Angeles event, Leader said there are sectors of the space industry developing technologies of interest to the government but for which a commercial market does not yet exist.\n\n\n\nAn example of that is on-orbit satellite services and alternatives to GPS navigation, he said. “DoD will have to be an anchor tenant for a while until a commercial market emerges … The intent is to help create those markets.”\n\n\n\nHe said the establishment of a Commercial Space Office was in response to the emergence of “companies and capabilities that we hadn’t seen before.”\n\n\n\nMost of the commercial space office’s efforts now are on contracting for satellite communications and for space domain awareness data. \n\n\n\nThere are still obstacles to buying services that are mostly bureaucratic. “Some of them are of our own making,” said Leader. “We actually want to put our money where our mouth is. It just takes a little bit longer with the budget cycles.”\n\n\n\nNot much will change until “we bake these commercial capabilities into our force designs, and into our budgets. It needs to be part of the baseline,” he said. \n\n\n\nOnce there is a budget line item for a commercial service, Leader added, it will be “very clear for industry and for the program executive officers to be able to execute.”\n\n\n\n“If folks don’t have their own dedicated line item for commercial capabilities within their mission area, it makes it kind of convoluted to try to find where that commercial money is actually available,” he noted. “So even if I talk to a PEO who’s willing to do some things commercially, it’s hard to get that message if you can’t point to a line item in the budget.”\n\n\t"},{"title":"BlackSky seeks to extend operations of satellites running on empty","link":"https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9ibGFja3NreS1zZWVrcy10by1leHRlbmQtb3BlcmF0aW9ucy1vZi1zYXRlbGxpdGVzLXJ1bm5pbmctb24tZW1wdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen","image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/2810mqsvJbGmlO-3tP_eAGzB4eK6iE8n4bJ-soeMmoVs1PpJERH2gpzqUg_dB3e0eWhjS1myiw0mEZJq2qUmhXcqwRpHiwr2hEhWpsRwvJunGJui7eqbl7V9tOuAGF8TDKncuQ8JEbiCCaXkhElx=s0-w100-h100-rw-dcTeGKtsQE","source":false,"datetime":"2023-05-05T11:55:08.000Z","time":"2 days ago","related":[],"text":"\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRendering of BlackSky's constellation of imaging satellites in low Earth orbit.

The company is requesting permission to operate the satellites at altitudes as low as 340 kilometers.\n\n\n\nMuch of the publicly available request is redacted, including a section under the heading “Emergency”. However, several passages in the document refer to refer to the spacecraft running out of the propellant needed to maintain their orbits.\n\n\n\n\nThe company said it is asking that the STA, initially lasting for 30 days for each satellite, “commence from the point in time that, due to the anticipated loss of remaining propellant, each such satellite is not able to be maintained at or above 385 kilometers.”\n\n\n\nElsewhere, the document notes that the extension of operations will not affect plans for post-mission disposal of the satellites through uncontrolled reentries. “BlackSky’s orbital debris mitigation plan is, and has always been, that the satellites will descend to the earth by force of gravity after exhaustion of propulsion capability,” the company stated. “Since the operational missions of the satellites will be extended for short periods after the loss of propulsion, the post-mission orbital lifetime of the satellites will be commensurately shortened.”\n\n\n\nThe company said it set 385 kilometers as the minimum altitude of operations for the satellites based on the expectation that atmospheric drag and other forces on the satellites would reach the limit of “operational stability” for them. However, the satellites have not shown any signs of reaching those limits, it noted.\n\n\n\n“Taking into account this operational experience and BlackSky’s engineering analysis based upon this experience, BlackSky is confident that it can operate the satellites as they descend below 385 kilometers while maintaining necessary stability at least until its satellites reach the new requested minimum altitude of 340 kilometers,” it stated.\n\n\n\nThe unredacted portions of the request provide no details about why the spacecraft are running out of propellant, although it appears to be earlier than expected. The two spacecraft launched as rideshare payloads on a SpaceX Falcon 9 Starlink mission in August 2020, and the STA notes the spacecraft have a three-year design life.\n\n\n\nAccording to the space tracking service Celestrak, the average orbital altitude of Global-7 has been declining since the beginning of the year, when it was at nearly 400 kilometers, with a steeper decline starting in early March, taking it to 389 kilometers as of May 4. The altitude for Global-8 has been going up in the last two months, from 388 kilometers at the beginning of March to 393 kilometers as of May 4. However, there has been a longer-term trend of declining altitudes dating back to June 2022, when it was at an altitude of 406 kilometers.\n\n\n\n\nThe company said in the STA, which is still pending at the FCC, that it is coordinating with other government agencies to ensure the operations of the two satellites in lower orbits do not cause any communications interference with other satellites. It is also seeking to amend its commercial remote sensing license issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to allow imaging at altitudes below 385 kilometers.\n\n\n\n“The system is designed with significant reserve and redundant capacity to eliminate impacts of any individual satellites that, as expected, will come in or out of service over time,” Lyn Chassagne, vice president of marketing at BlackSky, said in a statement to SpaceNews May 5. “With respect to the FCC filing, we will occasionally raise or lower altitudes of individual satellites as part of normal course of operations which can extend mission life, deliver increased performance, or support maintenance operations.”\n\n\n\nThe company, publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, has not made any other regulatory filings about the satellites. BlackSky is scheduled to release its first quarter financial results on May 10 before the markets open.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJeff Foust writes about space policy, commercial space, and related topics for SpaceNews.\n\nHe earned a Ph.D. in planetary sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a bachelor’s degree with honors in geophysics and planetary science...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore by Jeff Foust\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t"},{"title":"SAIC signs another commercial partner for its small satellite business","link":"https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9zYWljLXNpZ25zLWFub3RoZXItY29tbWVyY2lhbC1wYXJ0bmVyLWZvci1pdHMtc21hbGwtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWJ1c2luZXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen","image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Xg-JpkGeLa0vj4_BXUUb0Vpnm9OeyI-KW2eDjHhMny7cWRWWwhMrGW1Rxy5c3BdSpOjhURDbP6CNAy3PrdaVr2GazuuU79V9a1-kGnfXAU2i08e3uuk7vQCn2bdVGK6aZGoUOY16uunQS2R-y73poKQ-h8lncPBcsOpLKqORvo8MN-jnUm61=s0-w100-h100-rw-dcDWGK9MQE","source":false,"datetime":"2023-05-05T23:22:12.000Z","time":"2 days ago","related":[],"text":"\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllustration of GomSpace 8U cubesats.
