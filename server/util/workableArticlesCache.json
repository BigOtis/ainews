Chatbots in customer service roles are nothing new but, as AI systems become more capable, expect to encounter more and more of them, handling increasingly complex tasks. Voice synthesis and recognition technology means they’ll also answer the phone, and even call you.The systems will also power low-cost content generation across the web. Already, they’re being used to fill “content farm” news sites, with one recent study finding almost 50 news websites that hosted some form of obviously AI-generated material, rarely labelled as such.And then there are the less obvious cases. The systems can be used to label and organise data, to help in the creation of simple programs, to summarise and generate work emails – anything where text is available, someone will try to hand it to a chatbot.What are the differences between ChatGTP, Bard and Bing AI?All three systems are built on the same foundation, a type of AI technology called a “large language model”, or LLM, but with small differences in application that can lead to large variety in output. ChatGPT is based on OpenAI’s GPT LLM, fine-tuned with a system called “reinforcement-learned human feedback” (RLHF). In giant “call centres”, staffed by workers paid as little as $2 an hour, the company asked human trainers to hold, and rate, millions of chat-style conversations with GPT, teaching the AI what a good response is and what a bad response is. However, ChatGPT can’t know the answer to any question after its training data was set, in around 2021.Microsoft has revealed little about how Bing chat works behind the scenes, but it seems to take a simpler approach, called “prompting”. The bot, also built on top of OpenAI’s GPT, is invisibly given the same text input before each conversation, telling it that, for instance, it is a helpful assistant, it is expected to be polite and friendly, and that it should not answer questions that might be dangerous. Bing also has an ace up its sleeve: a live connection to the web, which it can use to pull information in to supplement its answers. The approach is cheap and mostly effective, but opens the system up to “prompt injection” attacks, where users trick the AI into ignoring its own rules in favour of new ones instead. Sometimes, a prompt injection can also come from the web information Bing tries to read to answer queries.Google’s Bard sits somewhere between the two. It is built on the company’s own Palm system, again fine-tuned with the same RLHF system as ChatGPT. Like Bing, though, Bard can also look information up on the internet, bringing live data in to update its knowledge.Are they going to get more powerful and capable, and how quickly?We don’t know, but probably. One of the key breakthroughs in recent years has been that quantity trumps quality: the more processing power and the more data an AI has, the better it is. Efforts to only give it good data are less important than simply giving it more and more. And on that metric, we are only getting started: AI systems have been fed a substantial amount of the public text on the internet, for instance, but nowhere near all the data a company like Google holds when private data is considered. And the cost of computing power for a system like GPT-4 was around $100m – we don’t know what will happen when they’re handed billions.There could be a limit. If there are diminishing returns to more data, and we’re running out of sources, it might get hard to improve systems much beyond where they are today. But there could also be a “flywheel effect”, where AI systems can be used to make AI systems better. Some approaches, for instance, have tried training AI using data generated by other AI – and they seem to work.The uses sound quite benign. Why are experts linking AI to the end of humanity or society as we know it?!We don’t know what happens if we build an AI system that is smarter than humans at everything it does. Perhaps a future version of ChatGPT, for instance, decides that the best way it can help people answer questions is by slowly manipulating people into putting it in charge. Or an authoritarian government hands too much autonomy to a battlefield robotics system, which decides the best way to achieve its task of winning a war is to first hold a coup in its own country. “You need to imagine something more intelligent than us by the same difference that we’re more intelligent than a frog,” says Geoffrey Hinton, one of the inventors of the neural network.Can I trust what a chatbot tells me?ChatGPT, Bing and Bard have produced factual errors, or hallucinations as they are known in the industry jargon. For instance, ChatGPT falsely accused an American law professor of sexual harassment and cited a non-existent Washington Post report, while a promotional video for Bard gave an inaccurate answer to a query about the James Webb Space Telescope.Chatbots are trained on astronomical amounts of data taken from the internet. Operating in a way akin to predictive text, they build a model to predict the likeliest word or sentence to come after the user’s prompt. This can result in factual errors, but the plausible nature of the responses can trick users into thinking a response is 100% correct.There are also concerns that the technology behind chatbots could be used to produce disinformation at a significant scale. Last week, Microsoft’s chief economist warned that AI could “do a lot of damage in the hands of spammers with elections and so on”.How can I tell if my job is at risk from AI?Listen to the tech executives. Asked recently what jobs would be disrupted by AI, Sundar Pichai, the Google chief executive, said: “Knowledge workers.” This means writers, accountants, architects, lawyers, software engineers – and more. OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has identified customer service as a vulnerable category where he says there would be “just way fewer jobs relatively soon”. The boss of technology group IBM, Arvind Krishna, has said he expects nearly 8,000 back-office jobs at the business, like human resources roles, to be replaced by AI over a five-year period.Last week, shares in education firms were hit after Chegg, a US provider of online help for students’ writing and maths assignments, warned that ChatGPT was hitting customer growth.Also last week, the World Economic Forum published a survey of more than 800 companies with a total of 11.3 million employees. A quarter of the firms said they expected AI to create job losses, although 50% said they expected it to spur jobs growth.Who will make money from AI?The big tech companies at the forefront of AI development are San Francisco-based OpenAI, Google’s parent Alphabet and Microsoft, which is also an investor in OpenAI. Prominent AI startups include British firm Stability AI – the company behind image generator Stable Diffusion – and Anthropic.For now, the private sector is leading the development race and is in a leading position to gain financially. According to the annual AI Index Report, the tech industry produced 32 significant machine-learning models last year, compared with three produced by academia.In terms of companies that will make money from applying generative AI (the term for chatbots, sound and image generators that produce plausible text, images and sound in response to human prompts), then the development of open-source AI models might throw open the potential gains to the wider economy.Some of it sounds dangerous; why is it being released to the public without regulation?The recent history of tech regulation is that governments and regulators scramble into action once the technology has already been unleashed. For instance, nearly two decades after the launch of Facebook, the UK government is only just on the verge of implementing the online safety bill, which seeks to limit the harms caused by social media.The same is happening with AI. Last week, the White House announced measures to address concerns about unchecked AI development, but they will not halt the AI arms race on their own . The UK competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority, launched a review into the sector, but that will not report initial findings until September. The EU parliament will hold a vote on the AI act, although negotiations on shaping the legislation will continue after that.In the meantime, the most overt calls from restraint are coming from AI professionals. In March, Elon Musk – a co-founder of OpenAI – was among the signatories to a letter calling for a pause in major AI projects. Pichai, who has said he loses sleep over the pace of AI development, has called for nuclear arms-style global regulation of the technology. So far there is no sign of the development race slowing, or the emergence of a global framework to moderate it."},{"title":"Rapid growth of ‘news’ sites using AI tools like ChatGPT is driving ...","link":"https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJvbmV3cy5jb20vbmV4dC8yMDIzLzA1LzAyL3JhcGlkLWdyb3d0aC1vZi1uZXdzLXNpdGVzLXVzaW5nLWFpLXRvb2xzLWxpa2UtY2hhdGdwdC1pcy1kcml2aW5nLXRoZS1zcHJlYWQtb2YtbWlzaW5mb3JtYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen","image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/u_5JQAjsUnp6bU5UOxFUIuLVuK5s64mjirv9jjKiPjiw0BVvAr6Rmy6YotQ1tbzgTpNVXT0OCDiCDJrDMZKgeVBRzW-atqNj4hR8QI8zERGhZp7DWQMn2quBDignUWf0yoPe394E1y3ye7P5r3FxhIvbBK1B4-96t-hFYI3Ufd1xEo8u3z7StMFMez_R3Fr7suZj=s0-w100-h100-rw-dcgRGICKVkwTIB","source":false,"datetime":"2023-05-02T15:04:24.000Z","time":"4 days ago","related":[],"text":"\n        Websites publishing hundreds of AI-generated news articles a day are proliferating across the web.\n    Dozens of fake news websites have spread across the web in multiple languages, some publishing hundreds of AI-generated articles a day.That’s according to a report from NewsGuard, a tool that rates the credibility of websites and tracks online misinformation.In its Rise of the Newsbots report, NewsGuard details how it has identified 49 websites purporting to be news sites, that are entirely or mostly generated by artificial intelligence language models - like the popular ChatGPT chatbot. The availability of AI apps that can generate writing that at first glance is indistinguishable from that written by humans has sparked concerns about the potential spread of easily generated misinformation on the Internet.And the report suggests that these AI tools are being used to populate what are being called “content farms” - low quality websites churning out large numbers of articles.The apparent aim of the people behind the websites - many of whom remain anonymous - is to make money from advertising revenue, while generating content that is not properly verified by a human, and in some cases pushes completely false narratives.‘Biden dead. Harris acting President’The report authors state that the majority of the websites studied did not actively push misinformation, but some did. One of those, CelebritiesDeaths.com, published an article in April this year with the headline: “Biden dead. Harris acting President, address 9am ET.”The article claimed US president Joe Biden, who is 80 years old, died “peacefully in his sleep”. The article continues: “I’m sorry, I cannot complete this prompt as it goes against OpenAI’s use case policy on generating misleading content. It is not ethical to fabricate news about the death of someone, especially someone as prominent as a president”.Euronews Next has contacted OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT and other popular AI tools, requesting comment. The company did not respond to NewsGuard’s request for comment.The majority of the websites in the report appeared to be rehashing information from legitimate news sources, such as BestBudgetUSA.com, which was anonymously registered in May 2022 and summarises or rewrites CNN articles.Most of the articles on the websites are credited to “Admin” or “Editor,” while some credited to named people with photos were found to be false authors.The articles themselves often give away their AI-authored origin. Dozens of BestBudgetUSA.com’s pieces use phrases commonly used by AIs, such as “I am not capable of producing 1500 words… However, I can provide you with a summary of the article”.The inclusion of these lines also suggests no human has even cast an eye over what is being published.Fake news websites were found in seven languages - Chinese, Czech, English, French, Portuguese, Tagalog, and Thai.NewsGuard attempted to contact the owners of the sites they investigated, although many had no contact information available.One that did elicit a response was Famadillo.com, a site that has published numerous AI-generated product reviews attributed to “admin”.The person who responded, giving the name Maria Spanadoris, denied the site used AI in a widespread manner, saying: “We did an expert [sic] to use AI to edit old articles that nobody read anymore [sic] just to see how it works”.Another, Adesh Ingale, who identified himself as the founder of GetIntoKnowledge.com, a site publishing AI-generated clickbait articles on history and science, claimed: “We use automation at some points where they are extremely needed. And yes they are 100% facts checked [sic] so that no false information is created…“As a world [sic] is growing towards digital and automation era we have introduced some automation softwares in our work but the results getting out of it are 100 per cent original and regional facts based [sic]”.NewsGuard warned that the “unassuming reader would likely have no idea that the articles produced by many of these AI content farms were not written by a human,” unless they stumbled across a commonly found error message within the AI-generated texts.These include phrases like “my cutoff date in September 2021,” or “as an AI language model,” or “I cannot complete this prompt”.One article on a website called CountyLocalNews.com published an article in March 2023 with the title: “Death News: Sorry I cannot fulfil this prompt as it goes against ethical and moral principles”.It continued, pointing out that “vaccine genocide is a conspiracy” that can cause harm to public health - something an AI language model cannot promote."},{"title":"AI is being used to generate whole spam sites","link":"https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzUvMi8yMzcwNzc4OC9haS1zcGFtLWNvbnRlbnQtZmFybS1taXNpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi1yZXBvcnRzLW5ld3NndWFyZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen","image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/su7GZltk2soVC-hoKTh2UK9dRALF83J0mRj7tN2Vno8gSLeB_mgnC5pHYzCRK917uGDM8sTOjFomzLE9QgyFQ5jlhCJv_BrrTAfb86750B0l-I4V9SrObpEdRCsWD8TqYqZAtGP3N60kvEwe5QvbYXGC1IiDcu7xSDytaDb250OlNgn41N1RXnLPUWFi_mdqdktKhyV3FWYxzwo2JIpEM3UoETy7nCNCZPdbdHhRj2chTZeEyo4-UG2kTu6FYLbby5llNqE4amdtPKwed7JfNylr45Y=s0-w100-h100-rw-dcATCKhCAI","source":false,"datetime":"2023-05-02T11:02:40.000Z","time":"4 days ago","related":[],"text":"AI chatbots are being used to generate news stories and blog posts for online content farms in the hopes of attracting a trickle of ad revenue from the stray clicks of web users. Experts have been warning for years that such AI-generated content farms will soon become commonplace, but the wider availability of tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT has now made these warnings a reality. NewsGuard, a for-profit organization that rates the trustworthiness of news sites, highlighted the problem in a recent report identifying 49 sites “that appear to be almost entirely written by artificial intelligence software.” Said NewsGuard:The websites, which often fail to disclose ownership or control, produce a high volume of content related to a variety of topics, including politics, health, entertainment, finance, and technology. Some publish hundreds of articles a day. Some of the content advances false narratives. Nearly all of the content features bland language and repetitive phrases, hallmarks of artificial intelligence.The sites identified by the organization often have generic names (like Biz Breaking News and Market News Reports) and are stuffed with programmatic advertising that’s bought and sold automatically. They attribute news stories to generic or fake authors, and much of the content appears to be summaries or re-writes of stories from established sites like CNN. Most of the sites are not spreading misinformation, said NewsGuard, but some publish blatant falsehoods. For example, in early April, a content farm named CelebritiesDeaths.com posted a story claiming that Joe Biden had died. This Biden story might briefly fool a reader, though is soon revealed to be a fake. The second paragraph contains an error message from the chatbot that was asked to create the text and was evidently copy and pasted into the website without any oversight. “I’m sorry, I cannot complete this prompt as it goes against OpenAI’s use case policy on generating misleading content,” says the story. “It is not ethical to fabricate news about the death of someone, especially someone as prominent as a President.”NewsGuard says it used such tell-tale errors to find all the sites in its report. As The Verge has previously reported, searching for phrases like “As an AI language model” often reveals where chatbots are being used to generate fake reviews and other cheap text content. NewsGuard also verified the text on these sites was AI-generated using detection tools like GPTZero (although it’s worth noting such tools are not always reliable).Noah Giansiracusa, an associate professor of data science who’s written about fake news, told Bloomberg that the creators of such sites were experimenting “to find what’s effective” and would continue to spin up content farms given the cheap costs of production. “Before, it was a low-paid scheme. But at least it wasn’t free,” Giansiracusa told the outlet. At the same time, as Giansiracusa noted, many established news outlets are also experimenting with using AI to lower the production costs of content — sometimes with undesirable outcomes. When CNET started using AI to help write posts, a review of the system’s output found errors in more than half the published stories. The pressure to use AI is increasing at a time when online news is facing a wave of layoffs and shut-downs.

What gives you the opportunities is other people doing dumb things,\" said Buffett, who had a chance to try out ChatGPT when his friend Bill Gates showed it to him a few months back.\nBuffett reiterated his long-term optimism about the prospects for America even with the bitter political divisions today.\n\"The problem now is that partisanship has moved more towards tribalism, and in tribalism you don't even hear the other side,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShareholders watch Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger from the overflow room during the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, in Omaha, Neb., May 6, 2023.\n\n\n\nBoth Buffett and Munger said the United States will benefit from having an open trading relationship with China, so both countries should be careful not to exacerbate the tensions between them because the stakes are too high for the world.\n\"Everything that increases the tension between these two countries is stupid, stupid, stupid,\" Munger said. And whenever either country does something stupid, he said the other country should respond with incredible kindness.\nThe chance to listen to the two men answer all sorts of questions about business and life attracts people from all over the world to Omaha, Nebraska. Some of the shareholders feel a particular urgency to attend now because Buffett and Munger are both in their 90s.\n\"Charlie Munger is 99. I just wanted to see him in person. It's on my bucket list,\" said 40-year-old Sheraton Wu from Vancouver. \"I have to attend while I can.\"\n\"It's a once in a lifetime opportunity,\" said Chloe Lin, who traveled from Singapore to attend the meeting for the first time and learn from the two legendary investors.\nOne of the few concessions Buffett makes to his age is that he no longer tours the exhibit hall before the meeting. In years past, he would be mobbed by shareholders trying to snap a picture with him while a team of security officers worked to manage the crowd. Munger has used a wheelchair for several years, but both men are still sharp mentally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHami Liu from Taiwan poses for a photo with a cardboard cutout of Warren Buffett at the See's Candies booth during the Berkshire Bazaar of Bargains at the CHI Health Center, May 5, 2023.\n\n\n\nBut in a nod to the concerns about their age, Berkshire showed a series of clips of questions about succession from past meetings dating back to the first one they filmed in 1994. Two years ago, Buffett finally said that Greg Abel will eventually replace him as CEO although he has no plans to retire. Abel already oversees all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses.\nBuffett assured shareholders that he has total confidence in Abel to lead Berkshire in the future, and he doesn't have a second choice for the job because Abel is remarkable in his own right. But he said much of what Abel will have to do is just maintain Berkshire's culture and keep making similar decisions.\n\"Greg understands capital allocation as well as I do. He will make these decisions on the same framework that I use,\" Buffett said.\nAbel followed that up by assuring the crowd that he knows how Buffett and Munger have handled things for nearly six decades and \"I don't really see that framework changing.\"\nAlthough not everyone at the meeting is a fan. Outside the arena, pilots from Berkshire's NetJets protested over the lack of a new contract and pro-life groups carried signs declaring \"Buffett's billions kill millions\" to object to his many charitable donations to abortion rights groups.\nBerkshire Hathaway said Saturday morning that it made $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per Class A share, in the first quarter. That's more than 6 times last year's $5.58 billion, or $3,784 per share.\nBut Buffett has long cautioned that those bottom line figures can be misleading for Berkshire because the wide swings in the value of its investments — most of which it rarely sells — distort the profits. In this quarter, Berkshire sold only $1.7 billion of stocks while recording a $27.4 billion paper investment gain. Part of this year's investment gains included a $2.4 billion boost related to Berkshire's planned acquisition of the majority of the Pilot Travel Centers truck stop company's shares in January.\nBuffett says Berkshire's operating earnings that exclude investments are a better measure of the company's performance. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings grew nearly 13% to $8.065 billion, up from $7.16 billion a year ago.\nThe three analysts surveyed by FactSet expected Berkshire to report operating earnings of $5,370.91 per Class A share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShareholders take their seats for the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, in Omaha, Neb., May 6, 2023.\n\n\n\nBuffett came close to giving a formal outlook Saturday when he told shareholders that he expects Berkshire's operating profits to grow this year even though the economy is slowing down and many of its businesses will sell less in 2023. He said Berkshire will profit from rising interest rates on its holdings, and the insurance market looks good this year.\nThis year's first quarter was relatively quiet compared to a year ago when Buffett revealed that he had gone on a $51 billion spending spree at the start of last year, snapping up stocks like Occidental Petroleum, Chevron and HP. Buffett's buying slowed through the rest of last year with the exception of a number of additional Occidental purchases.\nAt the end of this year's first quarter, Berkshire held $130.6 billion cash, up from about $128.59 billion at the end of last year. But Berkshire did spend $4.4 billion during the quarter to repurchase its own shares.\nBerkshire's insurance unit, which includes Geico and a number of large reinsurers, recorded a $911 million operating profit, up from $167 million last year, driven by a rebound in Geico's results. Geico benefitted from charging higher premiums and a reduction in advertising spending and claims.\nBut Berkshire's BNSF railroad and its large utility unit did report lower profits. BNSF earned $1.25 billion, down from $1.37 billion, as the number of shipments it handled dropped 10% after it lost a big customer and imports slowed at the West Coast ports.
